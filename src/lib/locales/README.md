# Note to localizers

Thank you for your interest in translating Sveltia CMS into your language! While we’re happy to have you on board, these strings are not quite ready for localization at this time.

- Most of the strings are unorganized/unpolished.
- Some strings are difficult to translate without context.
- Many strings, including invisible labels for screen readers, will be added before the 1.0 release as we implement more missing features.
- We’ll probably migrate from [svelte-i18n](https://github.com/kaisermann/svelte-i18n) to the [Fluent localization system](https://projectfluent.org/) to better handle singular/plural forms and even more complex grammars.
- Japanese localization is still needed for the [maintainer](https://github.com/kyoshino)’s Japanese clients.

If you’d like to localize the app, please [file an issue](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/issues) so we can ping you when it’s ready, hopefully by mid-2024!
