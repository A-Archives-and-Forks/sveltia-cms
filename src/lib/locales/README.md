# Note to localizers

Thank you for your interest in translating Sveltia CMS! While we’re happy to have you on board, these strings are not ready for localization at this time.

- Most of the strings are unorganized or unpolished.
- Some strings are difficult to translate without context.
- Many strings, including configuration error messages and invisible labels for screen readers, will be added before the 1.0 release as we implement more missing features.
- We’ll soon be migrating from [svelte-i18n](https://github.com/kaisermann/svelte-i18n) to the new [MessageFormat 2](https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg)-based sveltia-i18n library to better handle singular/plural forms and even more complex grammars.
- The existing Japanese localization is maintained for the [maintainer](https://github.com/kyoshino)’s Japanese clients.

If your language is not yet on the [waiting list](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/labels/l10n) and you’d like to localize the app, feel free to [file a new issue](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/issues) so we can ping you when it’s ready!
