# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Due to limited resources, we do not create branch releases for previous major/minor versions of Sveltia CMS. Instead, we only maintain the latest version.

For example, when version 2.1 is released, 2.0.x will no longer be supported. Likewise, when version 3.0 is released, 2.x.x will no longer be supported.

However, exceptions may be made in the event of critical security issues affecting a large number of users.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email us at [hello@sveltia.dev](mailto:hello@sveltia.dev). We will respond as soon as possible.

Although we do not offer a bug bounty program, if you report a security vulnerability in good faith, we will gladly acknowledge your contribution in our release notes.
