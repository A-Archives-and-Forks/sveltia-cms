# Contributing to Sveltia CMS

## Bug reports

Since Sveltia CMS is still in beta, we expect various problems. Please [report any bugs to us](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/issues) so we can make it better for everyone.

## Feature requests

Feel free to [submit feature requests](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/issues) as well, but please keep in mind that we have a lot of work to do before/after the 1.0 release, so we may not be able to fulfil your request anytime soon.

## Code contributions

Pull requests are not accepted for the time being due to limited review resources and the ongoing Svelte 5 migration. Please file issues instead.

## Localization

As we get closer to the 1.0 release, we’ll be welcoming [localizers](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/blob/main/src/lib/locales/README.md).

## Donation

Tips are always welcome! The project hasn’t set up a sponsorship program, but maintainer [@kyoshino](https://github.com/kyoshino) has a [PayPal account](https://paypal.me/kohei).

## Other things you can do

Last but not least, don’t forget to star this project and spread the word so more users can benefit from a better CMS experience!
